                    Our staff are trained to do their work to give you 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEE. If you’re unhappy
                    with our cleaning and feel as though our home cleaning professionals missed anything – let us know

                    <img class="bullet-p" />
                    That depends on the house. For your example, a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium takes up to 3
                    hours to clean.
